### Project Purpose: Netflix Clone Backend Application

#### *Project Overview*

The objective of this project is to build a backend application that mimics some of the functionalities of Netflix, such as retrieving user and movie data. The application is containerized using Docker and managed through a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment. The project uses AWS resources to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

#### *Key Requirements*

1. *Backend Application*:
   - A Flask-based web application.
   - Endpoints to fetch user and movie data.
   - Containerized using Docker.

2. *CI/CD Pipeline*:
   - Automated build, test, and deployment process.
   - Integration with GitHub Actions.
   - Environment-specific deployments (dev, uat, prod).

3. *AWS Resources*:
   - Use of EKS for Kubernetes.
   - ECR for Docker image storage.
   - IAM roles for managing permissions.
   - VPC for network isolation.

4. *TMDB API Integration*:
   - Fetch movie data from TMDB API.

5. *Branching Strategy*:
   - Branches: prod, uat, dev, and feature.
   - Developers work on feature branches, merge to dev.
   - dev merges to uat, and uat merges to prod upon approval.

#### *Detailed Requirements*

1. *Backend Application*:
   - Develop endpoints to handle user and movie data.
   - Ensure the application can be run in a Docker container.
   - Use Flask to build the API endpoints.

2. *CI/CD Pipeline*:
   - Automate Docker image build and push to ECR.
   - Use Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.
   - Automate Kubernetes deployment using kubectl.
   - Implement environment-specific configurations for dev, uat, and prod environments.

3. *AWS Infrastructure*:
   - *EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)*: Manage Kubernetes clusters.
   - *ECR (Elastic Container Registry)*: Store Docker images.
   - *IAM (Identity and Access Management)*: Manage permissions and roles.
   - *VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)*: Network configuration and isolation.

4. *TMDB API Integration*:
   - Fetch and display movie data from the TMDB API.
   - Secure API key management using AWS Secrets Manager.

#### *Implementation Details*

1. *Backend Application*:
   - *Flask Application*: Handle API requests and responses.
   - *Docker Container*: Encapsulate the application and its dependencies.
   - *Endpoints*:
     - /api/users: Fetch user data.
     - /api/movies: Fetch movie data from TMDB API.

2. *CI/CD Pipeline*:
   - *GitHub Actions*: Automate the build and deployment process.
   - *Steps*:
     - Checkout code.
     - Build Docker image.
     - Push Docker image to ECR.
     - Terraform apply to set up AWS infrastructure.
     - Deploy to Kubernetes using kubectl.
     - Tag subnets for Load Balancer.
     - Update kubeconfig for AWS EKS.
   - *Branches*:
     - *Feature*: Development of new features.
     - *Dev*: Integration testing.
     - *Uat*: User acceptance testing.
     - *Prod*: Production deployment.

3. *AWS Resources*:
   - *VPC*: Isolated network for the application.
   - *EKS Cluster*: Kubernetes management.
   - *ECR Repository*: Store Docker images.
   - *IAM Roles*: Permissions for EKS and ECS tasks.
   - *Subnets*: Network segments for EKS nodes and services.

4. *TMDB API Integration*:
   - *Flask Route*: Fetch and display movie data.
   - *API Key Management*: Secure handling of TMDB API key using AWS Secrets Manager.

#### *Expected User Experience*

1. *API Access*:
   - Users can access the API endpoints to retrieve data.
   - Example endpoints: /api/users and /api/movies.

2. *Deployment*:
   - Continuous integration and deployment ensure the latest changes are always available.
   - Environment-specific deployments allow for testing and validation before production release.

3. *Scalability*:
   - AWS EKS and ECS provide scalable infrastructure to handle increasing load.
   - Docker containers ensure consistent application deployment across environments.

4. *Reliability*:
   - Automated testing and deployment reduce the risk of errors.
   - AWS infrastructure provides high availability and fault tolerance.

By adhering to these requirements and implementation details, the project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and reliable backend for a Netflix-like application.
